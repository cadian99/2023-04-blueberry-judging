# Repay and liquidate race after unpausing

## Summary

The mitigation to prevent liquidations when repayments are disabled is not robust enough.

## Vulnerability Detail

In  the previous audit, an issue was accepted, that liquidations should not be possible when repayments are disabled:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry-judging/issues/290

The mitigation was adding a check if `isRepayAllowed`:
```solidity
    function liquidate(
        uint256 positionId,
        address debtToken,
        uint256 amountCall
    ) external override lock poke(debtToken) {
        if (!isRepayAllowed()) revert Errors.REPAY_NOT_ALLOWED();
``` 

However, this mitigation is not entirely correct. Once unpaused, if the position is in a liquidatable state, it will be a race between the repayer and liquidators who will call the corresponding functions (repay or liquidate) first.

## Impact

Repayments and liquidations share the same enable flag. Once repayments are allowed, if the user's loan is liquidatable, then liquidators can front-run repayments and take advantage of the current state.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If repayments were disabled, then after unpausing, I think there should be a gap, a safe period when the borrower first has a choice to repay or abandon the loan.
