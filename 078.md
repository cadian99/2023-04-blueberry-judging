# Undesired behaviour of chainlink feeds when sequencer is down

## Summary

No check to see if sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Vulnerability Detail

It is recommended to follow the code example of Chainlink:

[See this,](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code) but this is not being followed and as such the `answer` data returned in `latestRoundData()`, representing sequencer could be any of the following:

// Answer == 0: Sequencer is up
// Answer == 1: Sequencer is down

## Impact

Chainlink feeds lack check for when seqquencer is down

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Introduce a method to check if the sequencer is down in the protocol this could be done by implementing a boolean check as simple as the bbelow:

```solidity
 bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
        if (!isSequencerUp) {
            revert SequencerDown();
        }
```
