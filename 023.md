# Potential flashloan attack in openPositionFarm

## Summary

The AuraSpell and CurveSpell contracts allow the openPositionFarm function to execute the process of depositing funds, borrowing, and adding liquidity all in a single atomic transaction. This makes it possible for an attacker to perform a flash loan attack by borrowing a large amount of funds and manipulating the price of assets before the transaction is confirmed.

## Vulnerability Detail

An attacker can use a flash loan to borrow a large amount of tokens from a flash loan provider, then manipulate the price of assets on the market before the transaction is confirmed. The attacker can then use the manipulated price to make a profit on their initial flash loan. This can be done by performing a re-entrancy attack, where the attacker is able to call back into the AuraSpell or CurveSpell contract multiple times within the same transaction.

## Impact

A successful flash loan attack could result in a significant loss of funds from the Blueberry protocol. The attacker could borrow a large amount of funds, manipulate the price of assets, and profit from the manipulated price, leaving the Blueberry protocol with a large debt that it may not be able to repay.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate flash loan attacks, the contracts should ensure that the amount of collateral deposited by the user is sufficient to cover the value of the loan. Additionally, the contracts should be designed to prevent re-entrancy attacks by limiting the number of external calls made within a single transaction. One possible solution is to separate the lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision steps into separate transactions, rather than allowing them to be executed in a single atomic transaction.
