# Inconsistent error message format in SoftVault

## Summary

The error messages in the SoftVault contract have an inconsistent format, which could make it difficult for developers to quickly understand what went wrong in case an error occurs.

## Vulnerability Detail

The error messages in the contracts use different formats. Some error messages are written as normal strings, while others are defined as constants using the string constant or bytes32 constant keywords. This inconsistency could make it harder for developers to quickly understand what went wrong when an error occurs.

## Impact

Inconsistent error message formats could lead to confusion and errors in the code, as developers might have to spend additional time figuring out what went wrong. This could lead to longer development times and increased costs.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To ensure consistency in error messages, it is recommended to define error messages as constants using the string constant or bytes32 constant keywords. This will make it easier for developers to quickly understand what went wrong when an error occurs. It is also recommended to use the same format for all error messages in the contracts.
