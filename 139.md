# Funds can be stuck in the contract forever

## Summary

Funds can be stuck in the contract forever

**Likelihood:**
Low, because it require user to forcefully send funds to the contract

**Impact:**
High, because nobody will be able to withdraw them

## Vulnerability Detail

If a user who is directly interacting with the protocol sends ethers to the contract forcefully, nobody wouldn't be able to withdraw them. Due to the fact that all checks in the `transferFrom` and `withdraw` functions would fail since the `balanceOf[msg.sender]` won't be modified when funds are sent.

## Impact

Funds would be stuck without a way to withdraw them.

## Recommendation

Add a function that allows stuck funds to be withdrawn with the appropriate access modifiers.
