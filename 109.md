# ShortLongSpell would never work

## Summary
The ShortLongSpell contract would never work well, due to bugs in the deposit functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail
The existing bugs in the deposit functionality shows like this:

- `strTokenAmt` calculation would always revert due to underflow
```solidity
        uint256 strTokenAmt = _doBorrow(param.borrowToken, param.borrowAmount);

        IERC20Upgradeable swapToken = ISoftVault(strategy.vault).uToken();

        PSwapLib.megaSwap(augustusSwapper, tokenTransferProxy, swapData);
        strTokenAmt = swapToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - strTokenAmt;
```
The initial `strTokenAmt` is the balance of `swapToken`. Since `swapToken` is the `fromToken` for `megaSwap`, the remaining balance should be always less than the initial one. So it would always underflow if you try `swapToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - strTokenAmt`.

- Wrong invariant for `strTokenAmt` and `expectedAmount`
```solidity
        if (strTokenAmt < swapData.expectedAmount)
```
Even if the `strTokenAmt` is calculated correctly, `strTokenAmt` refers to the balance of `swapToken`, but `expectedAmount` refers to the balance of the finally swapped result token (e.g. USDT when swapping WETH > DAI > USDT). Direct comparison between different units.

- Inconsistent collateral
```solidity
        address vault = strategies[param.strategyId].vault;
        _doPutCollateral(
            vault,
            IERC20Upgradeable(ISoftVault(vault).uToken()).balanceOf(
                address(this)
            )
        );
```
Here `vault` refers to the SoftVault token, but the second parameter of `_doPutCollateral` refers to the balance of the underlying token of `vault`.

```solidity
/* BasicSpell.sol */
    function _doPutCollateral(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (amount > 0) {
            _ensureApprove(token, address(werc20), amount);
            werc20.mint(token, amount);
            bank.putCollateral(
                address(werc20),
                uint256(uint160(token)),
                amount
            );
        }
    }

/* WERC20.sol */
    function mint(
        address token,
        uint256 amount
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256 id) {
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(token).balanceOf(
            address(this)
        );
        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20Upgradeable(token).balanceOf(
            address(this)
        );
        id = _encodeTokenId(token);
        _mint(msg.sender, id, balanceAfter - balanceBefore, "");
    }
```
As you can see in these code, the `amount` should refer to the balance of `token` itself, not the underlying token.
I know, SoftVault basically shares the unit with its underlying token, but before that you need to deposit those underlying tokens.

## Impact

The contract would never work as expected

## Recommendation

Do not ever deploy untested, untidy code
Do not include it in the audit scope neither
