# AuraSpell can be compromised by a reentrancy attack

## Summary

AuraSpell uses the joinPool() function from BalancerVault, which can lead to a reentrancy vulnerability. The joinPool() function can be called by an attacker to recursively call into the AuraSpell contract and manipulate the state of the contract to the attacker's advantage.

## Vulnerability Detail

The joinPool() function used in AuraSpell can execute arbitrary external contract code through the IERC20.approve() and IERC20.transferFrom() functions. This creates the possibility of reentrancy attack, which occurs when an external contract calls a vulnerable contract's function repeatedly before the first invocation is finished.

For instance, if an attacker calls the openPositionFarm() function while also calling an external contract's fallback function that calls joinPool(), the attacker can use the approved tokens to manipulate the state of the AuraSpell contract in its favor.

## Impact

An attacker can use a reentrancy attack to drain funds from the contract or lock up assets indefinitely, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, making the system unusable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The AuraSpell contract should be updated to prevent reentrancy attacks by employing the checks-effects-interactions pattern. The pattern can be used to separate checks from interaction with external contracts and prevent reentrancy attacks. An option to consider is the use of the OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard library, which can be used to mitigate reentrancy attacks. Alternatively, the contract can be updated to use the transferFrom() and safeTransferFrom() functions from the OpenZeppelin library instead of the approve() and transfer() functions.
