# Missing access controls for internal functions

## Summary

Several internal functions in the contract do not have access controls, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive contract operations.

## Vulnerability Detail

The _doBorrow, _doRepay, _doERC20TransferIn, and _doERC1155TransferIn functions do not have any access control mechanisms in place, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive contract operations.

## Impact

An attacker could potentially exploit these missing access controls to manipulate contract state, leading to incorrect calculations or vulnerabilities in other functions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement access controls for these internal functions, such as using the onlyOwner or onlyAuthorized modifiers, to restrict access to only authorized parties. This will help prevent unauthorized manipulation of the contract's state and protect its users.
