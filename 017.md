# Incorrect Usage of SafeMath in BBMath Library

## Summary

The BBMath library defines a divCeil function to perform division with the ceil rounding. However, the function uses an incorrect implementation of SafeMath that may not guarantee the correct result in some edge cases.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `divCeil` function implementation in BBMath library can be simplified as:
```solidity
function divCeil(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return (a + b - 1) / b;
}
```
As the function uses SafeMath to prevent integer overflow, it should be implemented as:
```solidity
function divCeil(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    require(b > 0, "BBMath: division by zero");
    return (a + b - 1) / b;
}
```
This is because the (a + b - 1) term can overflow when a is close to the maximum value and b is 1. When this happens, the result of the division would be incorrect, and it may cause unexpected behavior.

## Impact

An attacker could manipulate the input values of divCeil function to force the incorrect calculation and result in unexpected behavior.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Would be recommended modifying the divCeil implementation by using the SafeMath library to ensure that no integer overflow occurs during the operation.
