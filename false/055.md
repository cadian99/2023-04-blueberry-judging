# Attacker can front-run AuraSpell#openPositionFarm to take away user's borrowToken

## Summary

The flow of `AuraSpell#openPositionFarm` has 7 steps. The 3th step is to add liquidity on Balancer to get lptoken. The implementation of this step cannot get any lptoken due to not calling `IBalancerVault.JoinPoolRequest`. So borrowToken is stuck in contract. In this way, the second parameter passed to `wAuraPools.mint` in the 7th step will be 0, resulting in revert. **However, if an attacker monitors   `AuraSpell#openPositionFarm` and finds it profitable, he can front-run it and transfer a certain amount of lptoken to AruaSpell**. So the transaction will not revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

Assume that **lpToken contains token0 and token1**. Alice's `borrowToken` is token0. Alice triggers `AuraSpell.openPositionFarm` by calling `BlueBerryBank.execute`. Bob monitors this tx and finds it is profitable, so he front-runs it. **The flow after being front-run by bob** is as follows:

1.  bob calls lptoken.transfer(address(AuraSpell), 10e18). Then **`lptoken.balanceOf(address(AuraSpell)) = 10e18`**. The following steps are alice's tx flow.
    
2.  call `_doLend` to deposit isolated collaterals.
    
3.  call `_doBorrow` to borrow 50e18 token0.
    
4.  `maxAmountsIn[0] = IERC20(tokens[0]).balanceOf(address(this)) = 50e18`.
    `maxAmountsIn[1] = IERC20(tokens[1]).balanceOf(address(this)) = 0`.
    `poolAmountFromA = (maxAmountsIn[0] * totalLPSupply) / balances[0]`, poolAmountFromA > 0.
    `poolAmountFromB = (maxAmountsIn[1] * totalLPSupply) / balances[1] = 0`.
    `poolAmountOut = poolAmountFromA > poolAmountFromB ? poolAmountFromB: poolAmountFromA = 0`.
    This makes `if (poolAmountOut > 0)` statement will not be met. `vault.joinPool` will be skipped. So this step will not get any lptoken. **50e18 token0 is stuck in contract**.
    
    ```solidity
    ......
                IBalancerVault vault = wAuraPools.getVault(lpToken);
                _ensureApprove(param.borrowToken, address(vault), borrowBalance);
    
                (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory balances, ) = wAuraPools
                    .getPoolTokens(lpToken);
                uint[] memory maxAmountsIn = new uint[](2);
    ->          maxAmountsIn[0] = IERC20(tokens[0]).balanceOf(address(this));
    ->          maxAmountsIn[1] = IERC20(tokens[1]).balanceOf(address(this));
    
                uint totalLPSupply = IBalancerPool(lpToken).totalSupply();
                // compute in reverse order of how Balancer's `joinPool` computes tokenAmountIn
    ->          uint poolAmountFromA = (maxAmountsIn[0] * totalLPSupply) /
                    balances[0];
    ->          uint poolAmountFromB = (maxAmountsIn[1] * totalLPSupply) /
                    balances[1];
    ->          uint poolAmountOut = poolAmountFromA > poolAmountFromB
                    ? poolAmountFromB
                    : poolAmountFromA;
    
                bytes32 poolId = bytes32(param.farmingPoolId);
    ->          if (poolAmountOut > 0) {
                    vault.joinPool(
                        poolId,
                        address(this),
                        address(this),
                        IBalancerVault.JoinPoolRequest(
                            tokens,
                            maxAmountsIn,
                            "",
                            false
                        )
                    );
                }
    ```
    
5.  call `_validateMaxLTV`.
    
6.  call `_validateMaxPosSize`.
    
7.  Since alice is a new user, so `pos.collateralSize` is equal to 0. This step will be skipped.
    
8.  `lpAmount = IERC20Upgradeable(lpToken).balanceOf(address(this)) = 10e18`, the 10e18 lptoken was transferred in by bob.
    

Alice has successfully created a position. 50e18 token0 is stuck in the contract. Now, **bob opened a new position, borrowToken is token1**. Because there are token0 and token1 in the contract, `vault.joinPool` is called to get some lptoken. Bob successfully opened his position. After that, he closes the position by `AuraSpell.closePositionFarm`. Attack completed.

## Impact

User suffers loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Spell can only borrow one type of token from the bank, so it is necessary to change the parameters of `IBalancerVault#joinPool` to support a single token to add liquidity. `JoinPoolRequest.userData` should be encoded as following:

- **Single Token Join**
    - userData ABI
        - `['uint256', 'uint256', 'uint256']`
    - userData
        - `[TOKEN_IN_FOR_EXACT_BPT_OUT, bptAmountOut, enterTokenIndex]`
