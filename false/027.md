# Function accrue() does not check if the caller of the function is authorized to trigger the interest accrual for the given bank

## Summary

The accrue function in the provided code block has a potential security issue. Specifically, it does not check if the caller of the function is authorized to trigger the interest accrual for the given bank. This means that any external account can call this function and trigger the accrual of interest for any bank, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access to funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

This means that any external account can call this function and trigger the accrual of interest for any bank, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access to funds.

which could potentially lead to unauthorized access to funds.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L306

    function accrue(address token) public override {
        Bank storage bank = banks[token];
        if (!bank.isListed) revert Errors.BANK_NOT_LISTED(token);
        ICErc20(bank.bToken).borrowBalanceCurrent(address(this));
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Here's an example implementation of the onlyBankOwner modifier:

modifier onlyBankOwner(address token) {
    require(msg.sender == banks[token].owner, "Only bank owner can trigger interest accrual");
    _;
}

You could then modify the accrue function to include this modifier:

function accrue(address token) public override onlyBankOwner(token) {
    Bank storage bank = banks[token];
    if (!bank.isListed) revert Errors.BANK_NOT_LISTED(token);
    ICErc20(bank.bToken).borrowBalanceCurrent(address(this));
}
