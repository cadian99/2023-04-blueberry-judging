# The return value of approve not checked

## Summary
 ERC20 missing return value check

## Vulnerability Detail
_ensureApprove() performs an ERC20.approve() call but does not check the success return value.
Some tokens do not revert if the approval failed but return false instead.

## Impact
Tokens that don't actually perform the approve and return false are still counted as a correct approve.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 I recommend putting the ERC20.approve() call in a require statement.
