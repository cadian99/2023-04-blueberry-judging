# updatePool() and add() will not work properly for Arbitrum due to block.number

## Summary
As mentioned on the contest page of sherlock, that the project is going to deploy on both mainnet and arbitrum
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95472385/235302655-768ef7cb-47be-47a0-9bdb-5441ee7fb42d.png)

The `lastRewardBlock` variable in the `add()` is used to keep track of the last block number where the rewards were calculated. If the `block.number` is incorrect, it could result in inaccurate calculations. Therefore, it's important to ensure that the `block.number` is accurate before using it in this function.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `add()` function of `MockIchiFarm.sol` `block.number` is being used which will not work properly on arbitrum. And same is the issue with `updatePool()` function
```solidity
uint256 lastRewardBlock = block.number; 
        totalAllocPoint += allocPoint;
        lpToken.push(_lpToken);
        addedLPs[address(_lpToken)] = true; 

        poolInfo.push(
            PoolInfo({
                allocPoint: uint64(allocPoint),
                lastRewardBlock: uint64(lastRewardBlock),
                accIchiPerShare: 0
            })
```
`updatePool() function`
```solidity
  if (block.number > pool.lastRewardBlock) {
            uint256 lpSupply = lpToken[pid].balanceOf(address(this));
            if (lpSupply > 0 && totalAllocPoint > 0) {
                uint256 blocks = block.number - pool.lastRewardBlock;
                pool.accIchiPerShare += uint128(
                    ((blocks *
                        ichiPerBlock *
                        pool.allocPoint *
                        ACC_ICHI_PRECISION) / totalAllocPoint) / lpSupply
                );
            }
            pool.lastRewardBlock = uint64(block.number);
```
