# HardVault.sol ,the function withdraw() does not check the token

## Summary

HardVault.sol ,the function withdraw() does not check the token

## Vulnerability Detail

The withdraw function in the HardVault contract seems to be missing some input validation. Specifically, it does not check whether the token address passed in is a valid ERC20 token address. This could potentially lead to a situation where a user is able to withdraw tokens that are not supported by the vault, or worse, tokens that do not exist.

## Impact

Affect the normal use of functions

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/vault/HardVault.sol#L126

function withdraw(
        address token,
        uint256 shareAmount
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256 withdrawAmount) {
        if (shareAmount == 0) revert Errors.ZERO_AMOUNT();
        IERC20Upgradeable uToken = IERC20Upgradeable(token);
        _burn(msg.sender, _encodeTokenId(token), shareAmount);

        // Cut withdraw fee if it is in withdrawVaultFee Window (2 months)
        _ensureApprove(
            address(uToken),
            address(config.feeManager()),
            shareAmount
        );
        withdrawAmount = config.feeManager().doCutVaultWithdrawFee(
            address(uToken),
            shareAmount
        );
        uToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, withdrawAmount);

        emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, withdrawAmount, shareAmount);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

we should ensure that only trusted token contract addresses are accepted as parameters, and use the whitelist.
