# When CoreOracle is paused, it is better to expose the paused/unpaused status so contracts using CoreOracle can know early about non availability

## Summary
When the CoreOracle is paused, it directly impacts many functions of BlueBerryBank. 
Examples below are

1. isWrappedTokenSupported
2. getWrappedTokenValue
3. getTokenValue
4. and more

but, the whenNotPaused() is attached only to _getPrice() which is called at the very end in the flow. The failure comes at the very end in the logic cycle.

## Vulnerability Detail
The error comes very late in the business logic cycle since the status of CoreOracle pause status is not being checked.

## Impact
Business functins fail:
Whitelisting will get in fine, but errors will be thrown during computation of position.

The token while whitelist might get in as a valid token, but eventually, the price will not be available and business logic will get "NO_ORACLE_ROUTE" error creating conflicts in the business flows down the line.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Two approaches:
a) attach whenNotPaused() modifier to all functions of CoreOracle contract
b) expose a public or external function on CoreOracle contract which can be checked by all clients before attempting any computation on valuation.
