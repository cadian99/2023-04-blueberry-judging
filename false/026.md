# IchiVaultOracle vulnerable to IchiVault owner change of twap period

## Summary

The IchiVaultOracle that uses Ichi vault to price the LP token does so using the vault twap and spot price. It checks that the twap period of the vault is not outside the range of constants defined by the protocol (1 hour - 2 days). This value is set by the owner of the Ichi vault and can be changed at anypoint. The owner of Ichi vault can make the oracle selectively revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

IchiVaultOracle's oracle getPrice uses `twapPrice0InToken1`:

```solidity
    function getPrice(address token) external view override returns (uint256) {
        ...
        uint256 spotPrice = spotPrice0InToken1(vault);
        uint256 twapPrice = twapPrice0InToken1(vault);
        ...
```

`twapPrice0InToken1` calls the Ichi vault and reverts when twap period is outside of range:

```solidity
    function twapPrice0InToken1(
        IICHIVault vault
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint32 twapPeriod = vault.twapPeriod();
        if (twapPeriod > Constants.MAX_TIME_GAP)
            revert Errors.TOO_LONG_DELAY(twapPeriod);
        if (twapPeriod < Constants.MIN_TIME_GAP)
            revert Errors.TOO_LOW_MEAN(twapPeriod);
```

twapPeriod can be set by owner of [IchiVault](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2a8E09552782563f7A076ccec0Ff39473B91Cd8F#code) (twap period is currently at the minimum accepted time of 1 hour):

```solidity
    function setTwapPeriod(uint32 newTwapPeriod) external onlyOwner {
        require(newTwapPeriod > 0, "IV.setTwapPeriod: missing period");
        twapPeriod = newTwapPeriod;
        emit SetTwapPeriod(msg.sender, newTwapPeriod);
    }
```

Owner of IchiVault is a [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfF7B5E167c9877f2b9f65D19d9c8c9aa651Fe19F).

## Impact

Owner of IchiVault can accidentaly break IchiVaultOracle by changing the twap period. 

Owner of IchiVault can maliciously and selectively update twap period to decide when the oracle will fail. If a position uses ichi vault tokens, the owner can prevent its repayment, its liquidation, or any other action. It can lock positions until they are liquidatable and liquidate them themselves. It can prevent their own position to be liquidated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make explicit your reliance on IchiVault's owner, the contest details only state reliance on Chainlink. If you rely on correct behaviour of the Ichi vault, remove the checks for twap period constraints.
