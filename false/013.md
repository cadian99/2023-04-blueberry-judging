# Lack of input validation for the amountCall parameter in the _doERC20TransferIn and _doERC1155TransferIn functions

## Summary

The _doERC20TransferIn and _doERC1155TransferIn functions do not validate the amountCall parameter, which may lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Detail

Both functions calculate the amount actually received by subtracting the balance before and after the transfer. However, there is no check for the amountCall being zero or excessively large, which could lead to incorrect calculations and unexpected contract behavior.

## Impact

An attacker could potentially exploit this lack of input validation to manipulate contract state, leading to incorrect calculations or vulnerabilities in other functions.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add input validation for the amountCall parameter in both functions to ensure it is within an acceptable range and not zero.
