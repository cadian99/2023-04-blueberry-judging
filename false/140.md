# users will steal/lose some CRV rewards from `WCurveGauge.sol`

## Summary
from [Curve Docs](https://resources.curve.fi/reward-gauges/understanding-gauges#the-weight-system)
```diff
The weight system
Each gauge also has a weight and a type. Those weights represent how much of the daily CRV inflation will be received by the liquidity gauge.
```
`WCurveGauge.sol` have [this logic](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WCurveGauge.sol#LL167C1-L176C6) to mint CRV reward for curve gauge and update the tracking system for reward
```solidity
    function _mintCrv(ILiquidityGauge gauge, uint256 gid) internal {
        uint256 balanceBefore = CRV.balanceOf(address(this));
        ILiquidityGaugeMinter(gauge.minter()).mint(address(gauge));
        uint256 balanceAfter = CRV.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 gain = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        uint256 supply = gauge.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (gain > 0 && supply > 0) {
            accCrvPerShares[gid] += (gain * 1e18) / supply;
        }
    }
```

## Vulnerability Detail
On this POC I will take as an assumption the gauge has a constant weight to simplify the computation.
 **This is the constant weight**: If you deposit in the gaugeX **10 LP tokens** you will receive **2 CRV** every week (so if you deposit 20  LP tokens you will receive **4 CRV** every week).
 
**THE TIMELINE STARTS HERE**
Day_one:
- **user_01** deposit in the gaugeX **10 LP tokens**
- the gain of this week = 0 CRV 
- total supply of CRV is 0 (in `WCurveGauge`)
- `accCrvPerShares [ GaugeX_ID ] == 0`

After_One_Week:
- **user_02** deposit in the gauge X **20 LP tokens**
-  the gain of this week = 2 CRV 
- total supply of CRV is 2 (these 2 CRV are only for **user_01**)
- `accCrvPerShares [ GaugeX_ID ] == 1` (the 1 [comes from](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WCurveGauge.sol#LL174C13-L174C28) `(gain / supply) + old value` so  (2 / 2) + 0 =1)

After_One_Week:
- **user_03** deposit in the gauge X **10 LP tokens**
- the gain of this week = 6 CRV (2 + 4) 
- total supply of CRV is 8 ( 4 CRV for **user_01** and 4 CRV for **user_02**)
- `accCrvPerShares [ GaugeX_ID ] == 1.75` (6 / 8) + 1 =1.75)

After_One_Week:
if any user decides to close his position we should have these results 
-  the gain of this week = 8 CRV (2 + 4 + 2) 
- total supply of CRV is 16 ( 6 CRV for **user_01**, 8 CRV for **user_02** and 2 CRV for **user_03** )
- `accCrvPerShares [ GaugeX_ID ] == 2.25` (6 / 8) + 1.75 =2.25)
**user_01** deposit **10 LP tokens** for 3 weeks ==> 2 CRV * 3 weeks = 6 CRV 
**user_02** deposit **20 LP tokens** for 2 weeks ==> 4 CRV * 2 weeks = 8 CRV 
**user_03** deposit **10 LP tokens** for 1 week ==> 2 CRV * 1 week = 2 CRV 

**THE END OF THE TIMELINE**

Let's take **user_01** as an example: (POC)
 **user_01** invoke [burn()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WCurveGauge.sol#L142-L163)
this logic will calculate the `rewards`

```solidity
        uint256 stCrv = (stCrvPerShare * amount) / 1e18;
        uint256 enCrv = (accCrvPerShares[gid] * amount) / 1e18;
        if (enCrv > stCrv) {
            rewards = enCrv - stCrv;
            CRV.safeTransfer(msg.sender, rewards);
        }
```
we have: (ignore 1e18 )
 `stCrv` = 0 * 10 = 0
 `enCrv ` = 2.25 * 10 = 22.5 (we only have 16 CRV in this contract)
 so `enCrv > stCrv` ==> `22.5 > 0 == true`
 ` rewards = enCrv - stCrv` ==> `22.5 - 0 = 22.5`
 so  `rewards` is `22.5` CRV this amount is not even here 
 
You can do different scenarios with all the users and some of them end up stealing rewards (e.g:**user_03**  will receive 5 CRV so he gets an extra 3 CRV) 
 
## Impact
users will steal/lose some rewards from `WCurveGauge.sol`

## Recommendation
Update this part 
```solidity
        if (gain > 0 && supply > 0) {
            accCrvPerShares[gid] += (gain * 1e18) / supply;
        }
