# Lack of Access Control for CoreOracle.setRoutes

## Summary

The setRoutes function in the CoreOracle contract allows the owner to set the oracle routes for tokens. However, there is no access control mechanism implemented in this function, which allows any user to set the oracle routes.

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently, any user can call the setRoutes function in the CoreOracle contract to set the oracle routes for tokens. This can be exploited by malicious actors to set incorrect oracle routes or to change the oracle routes without proper authorization.

## Impact

A malicious user could potentially manipulate the oracle routes to cause incorrect prices to be returned, leading to unexpected behavior in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement proper access control mechanisms for the setRoutes function, such as adding a modifier that restricts access to only authorized users. This would prevent unauthorized users from modifying the oracle routes, ensuring the security and integrity of the system.
