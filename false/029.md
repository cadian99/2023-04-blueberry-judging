# The burn function in the WAuraPools contract appears to be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

## Summary

The burn function in the WAuraPools contract appears to be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function first calls IAuraRewarder(balRewarder).withdraw(amount, true) to claim rewards, then auraPools.withdraw(pid, amount) to withdraw LP tokens, and finally transfers reward tokens and LP tokens to the caller. However, if the withdraw function in IAuraRewarder or the withdraw function in auraPools calls back into the WAuraPools contract, the burn function can be reentered before the transfer of tokens is complete, allowing an attacker to potentially drain the contract of tokens.

## Impact

appears to be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.


## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WAuraPools.sol#L228

function burn(
        uint256 id,
        uint256 amount
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        returns (address[] memory rewardTokens, uint256[] memory rewards)
    {
        if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
            amount = balanceOf(msg.sender, id);
        }
        (uint256 pid, ) = decodeId(id);
        _burn(msg.sender, id, amount);

        (address lpToken, , , address balRewarder, , ) = getPoolInfoFromPoolId(
            pid
        );
        // Claim Rewards
        IAuraRewarder(balRewarder).withdraw(amount, true);
        // Withdraw LP
        auraPools.withdraw(pid, amount);

        // Transfer LP Tokens
        IERC20Upgradeable(lpToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);

        // Transfer Reward Tokens
        (rewardTokens, rewards) = pendingRewards(id, amount);

        for (uint i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(
                msg.sender,
                rewards[i]
            );
        }
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this vulnerability, the burn function should be modified to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Specifically, the function should first transfer the LP tokens and reward tokens to a temporary contract, then call IAuraRewarder(balRewarder).withdraw(amount, true) and auraPools.withdraw(pid, amount) to claim rewards and withdraw LP tokens, respectively. Finally, the function should transfer the LP tokens and reward tokens from the temporary contract to the caller. This ensures that the transfer of tokens is completed before any external calls are made, preventing reentrancy attacks.

Example:

function burn(
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount
)
    external
    nonReentrant
    returns (address[] memory rewardTokens, uint256[] memory rewards)
{
    if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
        amount = balanceOf(msg.sender, id);
    }
    (uint256 pid, ) = decodeId(id);
    _burn(msg.sender, id, amount);

    (address lpToken, , , address balRewarder, , ) = getPoolInfoFromPoolId(pid);

    // Transfer LP Tokens and Reward Tokens to temporary contract
    IERC20Upgradeable(lpToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    (rewardTokens, rewards) = pendingRewards(id, amount);
    for (uint i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {
        IERC20Upgradeable(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), rewards[i]);
    }

    // Claim Rewards and Withdraw LP
    IAuraRewarder(balRewarder).withdraw(amount, true);
    auraPools.withdraw(pid, amount);

    // Transfer LP Tokens and Reward Tokens from temporary contract to caller
    IERC20Upgradeable(lpToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    for (uint i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {
        IERC20Upgradeable(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(msg.sender, rewards[i]);
    }
}
