# SoftVault doesn't implement the ISoftVault interface

## Summary
SoftVault doesn't implement the ISoftVault interface

## Vulnerability Detail
SoftVault doesn't have the `.bToken()` method from the Interface.

## Impact
SoftVaults cannot be deployed as they do not implement the needed interface. Contract cannot function properly without SoftVaults
Without this method major functionalities like `addBank` will always revert because of such lines 
```solidity 
address bToken = address(ISoftVault(softVault).bToken());
```
