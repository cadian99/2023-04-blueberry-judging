# Lend() doesn't call approve before safeTransferFrom is used.

## Summary
SafeTransferFrom and transferFrom methods need allowance from owner of erc20 tokens to be used.
## Vulnerability Detail
Both SafeTransferFrom and transferFrom functions in the ERC-20 standard require the sender to have an allowance for the ERC-20 tokens they are attempting to transfer.

The safeTransferFrom and transferFrom functions moves amount tokens from sender to recipient using the allowance mechanism. amount is then deducted from the callerâ€™s allowance.

## Impact
Without an allowance, the transfer will fail, and the transaction would be reverted.
