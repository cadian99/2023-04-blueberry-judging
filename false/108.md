# Stale prices can be used as lpPrice in _validateMaxPosSize()

## Summary
**Stale prices can be used as lpPrice in _validateMaxPosSize()**
## Vulnerability Detail
The _validateMaxPosSize()  function calls `bank.oracle().getPrice(address(lpToken))` and stores the gotten price to `lpTokens`.
The issue here is that the coreOracle.sol's `getPrice() function` calls _getPrice() function which doesn't take into account the time/blocktimestamp of when prices where last updated. 
Hence prices gotten by this call `bank.oracle().getPrice(address(lpToken))` can be far behind current price.
## Impact
`lpPrice` will be an outdated price and `curPosSize` will be wrongly calculated here 
```solidity
        uint256 curPosSize = (lpPrice * lpBalance) /
            10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(address(lpToken)).decimals();
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make _getPrice() in coreOracle.sol take time/blocktimestamp of the last update of  `px` here into account --
```solidity  
uint256 px = IBaseOracle(route).getPrice(token);
```
