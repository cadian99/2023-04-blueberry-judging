# The function `_doBorrow()` of `BlueBerryBank.sol` does not verify if value of `uBalanceBefore` is 0.

## Summary
The function `_doBorrow()` of `BlueBerryBank.sol` does not verify if value of `uBalanceBefore` is 0, which can lead to unnecessary calculation, unexpected issues and gas costs. This could mean adding 0 amount check in the `borrow`function (caller) itself. (Same goes for the repay function as well)

## Vulnerability Detail
function `_doBorrow()` of `BlueBerryBank.sol` does not verify if value of `uBalanceBefore` is 0 which can possible lead to unexpected issues / gas costs.

## Impact
function `_doBorrow()` of `BlueBerryBank.sol` does not verify if value of `uBalanceBefore` is 0 which can possible lead to unexpected issues / gas costs.

```javascript
function _doBorrow(
        address token,
        uint256 amountCall
    ) internal returns (uint256 borrowAmount) {
        address bToken = banks[token].bToken;

        IERC20Upgradeable uToken = IERC20Upgradeable(token);
        //!! Check uBalanceBefore value here.
        uint256 uBalanceBefore = uToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (ICErc20(bToken).borrow(amountCall) != 0)
            revert Errors.BORROW_FAILED(amountCall);
        uint256 uBalanceAfter = uToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        borrowAmount = uBalanceAfter - uBalanceBefore;
    }
```
