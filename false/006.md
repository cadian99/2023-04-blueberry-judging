# withdraw can be paused by the system

## Summary
In the docs, there is a  [statement](https://docs.blueberry.garden/lending-protocol/overview/governance#guardian)
>(Withdraw and repay of any market cannot be paused)

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a way to pause a CoreOracle now, that will disable repaying user position, because in the bank there is a transaction for a price, but Oracle is disabled so it will be reverted.
```solidity
    function _getPrice(
        address token
    ) internal view whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
        address route = routes[token];
        if (route == address(0)) revert Errors.NO_ORACLE_ROUTE(token);
        uint256 px = IBaseOracle(route).getPrice(token);
        if (px == 0) revert Errors.PRICE_FAILED(token);
        return px;
    }
```
