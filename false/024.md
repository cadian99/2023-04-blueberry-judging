# Unchecked return value of external call in joinPool and exitPool

## Summary

The AuraSpell and CurveSpell contracts contain an external call to a third-party contract without checking the return value of the call. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the contract and could allow an attacker to execute a re-entrancy attack.

## Vulnerability Detail

The AuraSpell and CurveSpell contracts make an external call to the joinPool and exitPool functions of the Balancer contract and the add_liquidity function of the Curve contract, respectively. These calls are made without checking the return value of the call, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.

An attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability by executing a re-entrancy attack. By calling back into the contract before the previous call has completed, an attacker can manipulate the state of the contract to their advantage.

## Impact

An attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the state of the contract, which could lead to unexpected behavior and result in a loss of funds for the Blueberry protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contracts should check the return value of external calls to ensure that they complete successfully before proceeding with the next step. If the call fails, the contract should revert the transaction to prevent further execution. Additionally, the contracts should be designed to prevent re-entrancy attacks by limiting the number of external calls made within a single transaction.
