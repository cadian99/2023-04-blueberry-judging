# Calculation underflow/overflow in BalancerPairOracle, which will affect pools in Aura Finance

## Summary
LP price calculation for Balancer Pair in BalancerPairOracle will produce calculation underflow/overflow (so Aura pools won't work too).

## Vulnerability Detail
- The values r0, r1 can underflow, e.g. if resA < resB --> r0 = 0, so it'll go to the else case --> and so `ratio` will be 0 --> `fairResA` calculation will revert upon dividing by 0.
- There are also other math calculations there that will cause reverts, e.g. ratio ** wB will lead to overflow. What you'd need here is Balancer's implementation of `bpow` or similar.

## Impact
LP price for Balancer-like collateral token will revert in most cases, if not all.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Change the calculation logic so it aligns with Alpha's original implementation (with precision control), e.g. https://github.com/AlphaFinanceLab/alpha-homora-v2-contract/blob/master/contracts/oracle/BalancerPairOracle.sol#L42-L53 (you can see there's BONE extra precision in each step)
