# Incorrect `liqThreshold` check in `BlueBerryBank.addBank()`

## Summary

liqThreshold could be less than or equal to Constants.MIN_LIQ_THRESHOLD and also could be greater than or equal to Constants.DENOMINATOR. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Having liqThreshold is on the edge (upper/lower limits), is not allowed.

## Impact
If liqThreshold is on the edge (upper/lower limits), it would still revert.

```javascript
if (liqThreshold > Constants.DENOMINATOR)
            revert Errors.LIQ_THRESHOLD_TOO_HIGH(liqThreshold);
if (liqThreshold < Constants.MIN_LIQ_THRESHOLD)
            revert Errors.LIQ_THRESHOLD_TOO_LOW(liqThreshold);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider replacing it by following code
```javascript
if (liqThreshold >= Constants.DENOMINATOR)
            revert Errors.LIQ_THRESHOLD_TOO_HIGH(liqThreshold);
if (liqThreshold <= Constants.MIN_LIQ_THRESHOLD)
            revert Errors.LIQ_THRESHOLD_TOO_LOW(liqThreshold);
```
