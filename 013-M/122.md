# AuraSpell#closePositionFarm requires users to swap all reward tokens through same router

## Summary

AuraSpell#closePositionFarm requires users to swap all reward tokens through same router. This is problematic as it is very unlikely that a UniswapV2 router will have good liquidity sources for all tokens and will result in users experiencing forced losses to their reward token.  

## Vulnerability Detail

[AuraSpell.sol#L193-L203
](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/AuraSpell.sol#L193-L203)

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {
            uint256 rewards = _doCutRewardsFee(rewardTokens[i]);
            _ensureApprove(rewardTokens[i], address(swapRouter), rewards);
            swapRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(
                rewards,
                0,
                swapPath[i],
                address(this),
                type(uint256).max
            );
        }

All tokens are forcibly swapped through a single router.

## Impact

Users will be forced to swap through a router even if it doesn't have good liquidity for all tokens

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow users to use an aggregator like paraswap or multiple routers instead of only one single UniswapV2 router.
