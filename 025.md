# takeCollateral() doesn't check whether the caller actually has a corresponding debt position in the bank

## Summary

this function is that it does not check whether the caller actually has a corresponding debt position in the bank. This means that an attacker could potentially call this function with a large amount value to drain the bank's collateral without actually having any debt to repay.

## Vulnerability Detail

this function is that it does not check whether the caller actually has a corresponding debt position in the bank. This means that an attacker could potentially call this function with a large amount value to drain the bank's collateral without actually having any debt to repay.

## Impact

an attacker could potentially call this function with a large amount value to drain the bank's collateral without actually having any debt to repay.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L793

 function takeCollateral(
        uint256 amount
    ) external override inExec returns (uint256) {
        Position storage pos = positions[POSITION_ID];
        if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
            amount = pos.collateralSize;
        }
        pos.collateralSize -= amount;
        IERC1155Upgradeable(pos.collToken).safeTransferFrom(
            address(this),
            msg.sender,
            pos.collId,
            amount,
            ""
        );
        emit TakeCollateral(
            POSITION_ID,
            msg.sender,
            pos.collToken,
            pos.collId,
            amount
        );

        return amount;
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In this implementation, the function first checks whether the caller has a corresponding debt position by verifying that the debtShare value is non-zero. If it is zero, then the function reverts with an error message indicating that the caller does not have a debt position. If the debtShare value is non-zero, then the function proceeds with transferring the requested amount of collateral back to the caller.

example:

function takeCollateral(uint256 amount) external override inExec returns (uint256) {
    Position storage pos = positions[POSITION_ID];
    if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
        amount = pos.collateralSize;
    }
    if (pos.debtShare == 0) {
        revert Errors.NO_DEBT_POSITION();
    }
    pos.collateralSize -= amount;
    IERC1155Upgradeable(pos.collToken).safeTransferFrom(
        address(this),
        msg.sender,
        pos.collId,
        amount,
        ""
    );
    emit TakeCollateral(
        POSITION_ID,
        msg.sender,
        pos.collToken,
        pos.collId,
        amount
    );

    return amount;
}
