# `AuraSpell`'s Balancer pool exit will always revert

## Summary

In `AuraSpell.closePositionFarm`, the call to `BalancerVault.exitPool` is not properly encoded and will always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

All Balancer Vault operations include an input argument called `userData`. This is optional for all known swaps, but it is very much required for all known joins and exits. In `AuraSpell.closePositionFarm`, a call to `BalancerVault.exitPool` leaves the `userData` empty. As a result, the exit will always revert, and it will be impossible to close a position.

## Impact

It is not possible to close a position using the `AuraSpell`.

## Code Snippet

[spell/AuraSpell.sol#L184-189](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/AuraSpell.sol#L184-L189), annotated below for clarity.

```solidity
wAuraPools.getVault(lpToken).exitPool(
    IBalancerPool(lpToken).getPoolId(),
    address(this),
    address(this),
    IBalancerVault.ExitPoolRequest(tokens, minAmountsOut, "", false) // @audit-info The "" here is empty `userData`.
);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

First, create an integration test for the Aura spell. There are tests for Convex, Curve, and Ichi, but not Aura. A test would likely have caught this issue.

To fix the issue, consult the [Balancer docs on pool exits](https://docs.balancer.fi/reference/joins-and-exits/pool-exits.html). The safest exit type is the "proportional" exit, whose `userData` looks like:

```solidity
[uint256, uint256]
[EXACT_BPT_IN_FOR_TOKENS_OUT, bptAmountIn]
```

Note that if we choose the proportional exit, we will get all underlying tokens out and will have to deal with each one.
