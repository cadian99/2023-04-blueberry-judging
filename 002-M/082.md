# The Oracle data feed still lacks sufficient validation.

## Summary

Though similar case has been reported in former contest, the Oracle data feed is still insufficiently validated as not all advised checks have been added to protocol

## Vulnerability Detail

Insufficient validation of oracle's data feed is present. There is no complete check for stale prices and rounding. Price can be stale, leading to incorrect return amounts.

```solidity
  /**
     * @notice Returns the USD price of given token, price value has 18 decimals
     * @param token_ Token address to get price of
     * @return price USD price of token in 18 decimal
     */
    function getPrice(address token_) external view override returns (uint256) {
        // remap token if possible
        address token = remappedTokens[token_];
        if (token == address(0)) token = token_;

        uint256 maxDelayTime = timeGaps[token];
        if (maxDelayTime == 0) revert Errors.NO_MAX_DELAY(token_);

        // Get token-USD price
        uint256 decimals = registry.decimals(token, USD);
        (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = registry.latestRoundData(
            token,
            USD
        );
        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime)
            revert Errors.PRICE_OUTDATED(token_);
        if (answer <= 0) revert Errors.PRICE_NEGATIVE(token_);

        return
            (answer.toUint256() * Constants.PRICE_PRECISION) / 10 ** decimals;
    }
```

## Impact

It is possible for price to be stale, resulting in the return value provided being wrong.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make a complete validation of the data feed

```solidity
(uint80 roundID, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = registry.latestRoundData(
            token,
            USD
        );
    require(answer > 0, "invalid_oracle_answer");
    require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "ChainLink: Stale price");
    require(updatedAt > 0, "ChainLink: Round not complete");
    require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "round not complete");

```
