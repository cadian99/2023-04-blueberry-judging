# H-03 Attacker could steal all the borrowBalance from Aura SPELL

## Summary
When Aura SPELL gets to the third step to add liquidity on Balancer to get BPT tokens on `openPositionFarm()`
at that point, the only token on the SPELL should `param.borrowToken` (except if a malicious user sends a dust amount for every token,...)  

## Vulnerability Detail
On these lines from [openPositionFarm](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/AuraSpell.sol#L99-L105)
```solidity
            uint poolAmountFromA = (maxAmountsIn[0] * totalLPSupply) /
                balances[0];
            uint poolAmountFromB = (maxAmountsIn[1] * totalLPSupply) /
                balances[1];
            uint poolAmountOut = poolAmountFromA > poolAmountFromB
                ? poolAmountFromB
                : poolAmountFromA;
```
it is trying to find the amount of `param.borrowToken`  
In case we have only one token `param.borrowToken`  one of `poolAmountFromA`/`poolAmountFromB` should be zero
e.g:
Let's say `poolAmountFromA == 10` and `poolAmountFromB == 0`
we need to get `poolAmountOut == 10`

we have `10 > 0` ==> true
so  `poolAmountOut == poolAmountFromB` which is zero

this will lead to outrunning this block
```solidity
            if (poolAmountOut > 0) {//?@audit -this should revert if it false
                vault.joinPool(
                    poolId,
                    address(this),
                    address(this),
                    IBalancerVault.JoinPoolRequest(
                        tokens,
                        maxAmountsIn,
                        "",
                        false
                    )
                );
            }
```
To make this issue worse an attacker could send some BPT to the SPELL first and in case the user has (lend) a big amount as `IsolatedCollateral`  and invoke `openPositionFarm()` all the `borrowBalance` will stay on the SPELL. an attacker could invoke `closePositionFarm()` to receive the `borrowBalance` from the SPELL by `_doRefund()` function 

## Impact
- Aura SPELL will never send BPT to the Balancer pool.
- an attacker could steal all the `borrowBalance`

## Recommendation
```diff
            uint poolAmountFromA = (maxAmountsIn[0] * totalLPSupply) /
                balances[0];
            uint poolAmountFromB = (maxAmountsIn[1] * totalLPSupply) /
                balances[1];
-            uint poolAmountOut = poolAmountFromA > poolAmountFromB
+            uint poolAmountOut = poolAmountFromA < poolAmountFromB
                ? poolAmountFromB
                : poolAmountFromA;
```
