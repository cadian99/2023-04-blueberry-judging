# `AuraSpell` does not validate that `borrowToken` belongs to the underlying pool

## Summary

In `AuraSpell.openPositionFarm`, the `param.borrowToken` is never validated. It is therefore possible to borrow any arbitrary token from the `BlueBerryBank` and leave the borrowed tokens stuck in the `AuraSpell` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

`AuraSpell.openPositionFarm` does not validate `param.borrowToken` as a constituent of the underlying Balancer pool. The ensuing logic computes `poolAmountOut` using the `AuraSpell`'s balances of the true underlying tokens, and it gracefully skips the `BalancerVault.joinPool` step if `poolAmountOut` is zero.

Therefore, borrowing a non-pool token from the `BlueBerryBank` will actually succeed and create a debt, but those borrowed tokens will remain stuck in the `AuraSpell` contract.

## Impact

Tokens can be borrowed without utilization, creating a debt and leaving the borrowed tokens stuck.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

First, create an integration test for the Aura spell. There are tests for Convex, Curve, and Ichi, but not Aura. A test would likely have caught this issue.

See the `IchiSpell` for an example of proper validation.
