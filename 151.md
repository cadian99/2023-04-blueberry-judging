# PausableUpgradable contract not initialized in the CoreOracle Contract.

## Summary
The `__Pausable_init()` is not invoked in the CoreOracle smart contract. The CoreOracle Smart contract inherits from the PausableUpgradable contract but the PausableUpgradable is not initialized as recommended by openzeppelin.

## Vulnerability Detail
The CoreOracle smart contract inherits from the PausableUpgradable smart contract but the ` __Pausable_init()` is not invoked in the initialize function of the CoreOracle smart contract which will make it not initialize the PausableUpgradable smart contract as recommended by openzeppelin.
```solidity
function initialize() external initializer {
        __Ownable_init(); //@audit PausableUpgradable init function not called
    }
```
Reference: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable

## Impact
The Pausable Upgradable will not be initialized to the default state.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure to invoke all the init functions of inherited upgradable smart contracts with the code below in the CoreOracle.sol file.
```diff
function initialize() external initializer {
        __Ownable_init();
//Initialize the PausableUpgradable contract
+        __Pausable_init();
    }
```
