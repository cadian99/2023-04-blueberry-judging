# Dos attack to openPositionFarm()

## Summary
 A bad actor can transfer 1 wei worth of the corresponding  token to the protocol before user calling the `openPositionFarm()` function, in order to increase the protocol's balance and build an LP position to call ICurvePool(pool).add_liquidity(), since the protocol only allows the curvel pool to spend the borrowed token, this will cause an error when Curve attempts to transfer other tokens out of the protocol.


## Vulnerability Detail
The `openPositionFarm()` function is used to add liquidity to Curve pool with 2 underlying tokens, with staking to Curve gauge. When add liquidity on curve ,the protocol use the borrowed token and the collateral token, it checks the number of tokens in the pool and creates an array of the supplied token amounts to be passed to the add_liquidity function.If the pool contains three tokens, the process is repeated with an array of three elements, and if the pool contains four tokens, an array of four elements is created and used. Here is the problem,a bad actor may transfer 1 wei worth of the corresponding  token to the protocol before user calling the `openPositionFarm()` function, in order to increase the protocol's balance and build an LP position to call ICurvePool(pool).add_liquidity(). However, since the protocol only allows the curvel pool to spend the borrowed token, this will cause an error when Curve attempts to transfer other tokens out of the protocol.

  uint256 borrowBalance = _doBorrow(
            param.borrowToken,
            param.borrowAmount
        );

        // 3. Add liquidity on curve
        _ensureApprove(param.borrowToken, pool, borrowBalance);
        if (tokens.length == 2) {
            uint256[2] memory suppliedAmts;
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
                suppliedAmts[i] = IERC20Upgradeable(tokens[i]).balanceOf(
                    address(this)
                );
            }
            ICurvePool(pool).add_liquidity(suppliedAmts, minLPMint);
        } else if (tokens.length == 3) {
            uint256[3] memory suppliedAmts;
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                suppliedAmts[i] = IERC20Upgradeable(tokens[i]).balanceOf(
                    address(this)
                );
            }
            ICurvePool(pool).add_liquidity(suppliedAmts, minLPMint);
        } else if (tokens.length == 4) {
            uint256[4] memory suppliedAmts;
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                suppliedAmts[i] = IERC20Upgradeable(tokens[i]).balanceOf(
                    address(this)
                );
            }
            ICurvePool(pool).add_liquidity(suppliedAmts, minLPMint);
        }

```
## Impact
User will not able to call the `openPositionFarm()` function to add liquidity to Curve pool
