# Pending CRV rewards are not accounted for and can cause unfair liquidations

## Summary

pendingRewards are factored into the health of a position so that the position collateral is fairly assessed. However WCurveGauge#pendingRewards doesn't return the proper reward tokens/amounts meaning that positions aren't valued correctly and users can be unfairly liquidated.

## Vulnerability Detail

[BlueBerryBank.sol#L408-L413](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L408-L413)

            (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory rewards) = IERC20Wrapper(
                pos.collToken
            ).pendingRewards(pos.collId, pos.collateralSize);
            for (uint256 i; i < tokens.length; i++) {
                rewardsValue += oracle.getTokenValue(tokens[i], rewards[i]);
            }

When BlueBerryBank is valuing a position it also values the pending rewards since they also have value. 

[WCurveGauge.sol#L106-L114](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WCurveGauge.sol#L106-L114)

    function pendingRewards(
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 amount
    )
        public
        view
        override
        returns (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory rewards)
    {}

Above we see that WCurveGauge#pendingRewards returns empty arrays when called. This means that pending rewards are not factored in correctly and users can be liquidated when even when they should be safe.

## Impact

User is liquidated when they shouldn't be
