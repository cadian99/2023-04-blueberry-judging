# Users can fail to closePositionFarm and lose their funds

## Summary
If self.is_killed in the curve pool contract  becomes true, user may be unable to call the `CurveSpell.closePositionFarm()` function to  repay his debt, resulting in his assets being liquidated.


## Vulnerability Detail
The `CurveSpell.closePositionFarm()` function is used to unwind a position on a strategy that involves farming CRV rewards through staking LP tokens in a Curve pool. Inside the function, the protocol swaps the harvested CRV tokens to the debt token, and calculates the actual amount of LP tokens to remove from the Curve pool. It then removes the LP tokens using the remove_liquidity_one_coin function of the Curve pool. 
```solidity
   int128 tokenIndex;
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
                if (tokens[i] == pos.debtToken) {
                    tokenIndex = int128(uint128(i));
                    break;
                }
            }

            ICurvePool(pool).remove_liquidity_one_coin(
                amountPosRemove,
                int128(tokenIndex),
                0
            );
        }

        // 5. Withdraw isolated collateral from Bank
        _doWithdraw(param.collToken, param.amountShareWithdraw);

        // 6. Repay
        {
            // Compute repay amount if MAX_INT is supplied (max debt)
            uint256 amountRepay = param.amountRepay;
            if (amountRepay == type(uint256).max) {
                amountRepay = bank.currentPositionDebt(bank.POSITION_ID());
            }
            _doRepay(param.borrowToken, amountRepay);
        }

        _validateMaxLTV(param.strategyId);
```
If self.is_killed in the curve pool contract  becomes true, calling such `remove_liquidity_one_coin()` function would always revert. In this case, calling the `CurveSpell.closePositionFarm()` function reverts. When user's position is about to be liquidated, if the `closePositionFarm()` function is DOS'ed,user may be unable to repay his debt, resulting in the user losing their funds
```solidity
def remove_liquidity_one_coin(
    _token_amount: uint256,
    i: int128,
    _min_amount: uint256
) -> uint256:
    """
    @notice Withdraw a single coin from the pool
    @param _token_amount Amount of LP tokens to burn in the withdrawal
    @param i Index value of the coin to withdraw
    @param _min_amount Minimum amount of coin to receive
    @return Amount of coin received
    """
    assert not self.is_killed  # dev: is killed

    dy: uint256 = 0
    dy_fee: uint256 = 0
    dy, dy_fee = self._calc_withdraw_one_coin(_token_amount, i)

```

## Impact
If self.is_killed in the curve pool contract  becomes true, user may be unable to repay his debt, resulting in his assets being liquidated.
