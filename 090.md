# Only 1 bank can be added to a certain token

## Summary
A token might be linked to one bank only

## Vulnerability Detail
When creating a bank, an instance of it is created in the mapping `banks[token]`. Since the key value to the mapping is the token, a single token can only be linked to a single bank. This heavily limits the project functionality for popularly used tokens. If another bank is attempted to be created for the same token it will revert on the following line

## Impact
Only one bank can be created to a token, limiting its possibilities

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add functionality to be possible to create multiple banks to a token => instead of using the token as key value to the `banks` mapping, use an `id`
