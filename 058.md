# No Slippage Protection while Swapping tokens through uniswap router

## Summary

While Closing Position Farm in `AuraSpell`, `convexSpell` and `curveSpell`, there is a use of Uniswap Router which uses `swapExactTokensForTokens` method call to Swap rewards tokens to debt token. But the value of `amountOutMinimum` is set to be zero which allows 100% Value Slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `closePositionFarm` method of all the 3 spell contracts, there is no slippage control while swapping the reward tokens into debt tokens which means that a malicious actor could, e.g., trivially insert transactions before and after the naive transaction (using the infamous "sandwich" attack), causing the smart contract to trade at a radically worse price, profit from this at the caller's expense, and then return the contracts to their original state, all at a low cost.

## Impact

Loss of Funds.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: AuraSpell.sol

  swapRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(
      rewards,
      0,
      swapPath,
      address(this),
      type(uint256).max
  );

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a require check at the end of swap to make sure that slippage is not higher than user allowed slippage.
