# H-05 missing protection slippage

## Summary


## Vulnerability Detail
On this part of [ConvexSpell.closePositionFarm()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/ConvexSpell.sol#L195-L209)
```solidity
            // 4. Remove liquidity
            int128 tokenIndex;
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
                if (tokens[i] == pos.debtToken) {
                    tokenIndex = int128(uint128(i));
                    break;
                }
            }

            ICurvePool(pool).remove_liquidity_one_coin(
                amountPosRemove,
                int128(tokenIndex),
                0
            );
        }
```
The SPELL will remove the liquidity from Curve Pool (to pay back the borrowed amount to Compound ) with a 0 value for the [_min_amount](https://curve.readthedocs.io/factory-pools.html?highlight=remove_liquidity_one_coin#StableSwap.remove_liquidity_one_coin) (Minimum amount of the coin to receive)

so the slippage/minimum amount of tokens to be received is set to a zero value. Thus, the Curve Pool will continue to redeem the pool tokens even if the trade incurs significant slippage

## Impact
- the SPELL could receive leas tokens in return, leading the user to losses for the rewards.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The proper way of computing the minimum amount of tokens to receive from a single-side trade (remove_liquidity_one_coin) is to call the Curve Pool's [calc_withdraw_one_coin](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/b0bbf77f8f93c9c5f4e415bce9cd71f0cdee960e/contracts/pools/steth/StableSwapSTETH.vy#L646) function off-chain to calculate the amount received when withdrawing a single LP Token, and then apply an acceptable discount.
