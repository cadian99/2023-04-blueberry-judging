# All spell's `closePositionFarm` function can be attacked by sandwich attack

## Summary

All spell's `closePositionFarm` function can be attacked by sandwich attack

## Vulnerability Detail

Take `AuraSpell.sol` contract as an example.

```solidity
File: spell/AuraSpell.sol
192         // 4. Swap rewards tokens to debt token
193         for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {
194             uint256 rewards = _doCutRewardsFee(rewardTokens[i]);
195             _ensureApprove(rewardTokens[i], address(swapRouter), rewards);
196             swapRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(
197                 rewards,
198                 0,
199                 swapPath[i],
200                 address(this),
201                 type(uint256).max
202             );
203         }
```

The `closePositionFarm` function will replace all rewarded tokens with debt tokens. This can lead to a sandwich attack due to no set minimum number of receive.

## Impact

Some of the user's funds were stolen.
