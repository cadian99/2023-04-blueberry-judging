# AuraSpell executes swaps without slippage protection

## Summary
The AuraSpell protocol executes swaps without slippage protection. That will cause a loss of funds because of sandwich attacks.


## Vulnerability Detail
In `AuraSpell .closePositionFarm()`  swaps are executed through the `swapRouter`.The `amountOutMin` value has been set to 0. Without slippage protection, this is vulnerable to sandwich attacks

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {
            uint256 rewards = _doCutRewardsFee(rewardTokens[i]);
            _ensureApprove(rewardTokens[i], address(swapRouter), rewards);
            swapRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(
                rewards,
                0,
                swapPath[i],
                address(this),
                type(uint256).max
            );
        }

```

## Impact
Swaps will be sandwiched causing a loss of funds for users you withdraw their rewards.
