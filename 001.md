# setTokenRemappings() of ChainlinkAdapterOracle contract should check for address(0) for remappedTokens_

## Summary
SetTokenRemapping is updating the remapping of tokens for the chainlink oracle. The function is checking for mapped token to be a non-zero address, but should also check for target mapping values also to be non zero address.

## Vulnerability Detail
Potentially mapping a valid token to zero address as a pair. The isue is marked medium as the ability to do this update is available only to the owner of this contract. 

## Impact
Since this pair like BTC -> ZERO is not of interest to any one, it is not high for normal use case point of view. Might bring some vulnerability and hence should be fixed. The code for most part checks for address(0) very deligently, so, this might be a miss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check for remappedTokens_ element to be not equal to zero address as below.

function setTokenRemappings(
        address[] calldata tokens_,
        address[] calldata remappedTokens_
    ) external onlyOwner {
        if (remappedTokens_.length != tokens_.length)
            revert Errors.INPUT_ARRAY_MISMATCH();
        for (uint256 idx = 0; idx < tokens_.length; idx++) {
            if (tokens_[idx] == address(0)) revert Errors.ZERO_ADDRESS();
            **if (remappedTokens_[idx] == address(0)) revert Errors.ZERO_ADDRESS();**

            remappedTokens[tokens_[idx]] = remappedTokens_[idx];
            emit SetTokenRemapping(tokens_[idx], remappedTokens_[idx]);
        }
    }
