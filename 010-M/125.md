# Issue 327 from previous contest has not been fixed

## Summary

[Issue 327](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry-judging/issues/327) has not been fixed. The issue is labeled as "Won't Fix" but dev comments indicates that they are still meant to be fixed. Comments from discord:

[Watson Question: ](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1100436073055780894/1101829382768697415)

`@Gornutz | Blueberry I assume findings that address issues that were marked as "won't fix" in the previous contest are not valid, is that correct?`

[Dev Response: ](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1100436073055780894/1101911014892638390)

`they were fixed but not by the solution provided`

## Vulnerability Detail

[BasicSpell.sol#L198-L207](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/BasicSpell.sol#L198-L207)

    function _validateMaxPosSize(uint256 strategyId) internal view {
        Strategy memory strategy = strategies[strategyId];
        IERC20Upgradeable lpToken = IERC20Upgradeable(strategy.vault);
        uint256 lpBalance = lpToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 lpPrice = bank.oracle().getPrice(address(lpToken));
        uint256 curPosSize = (lpPrice * lpBalance) /
            10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(address(lpToken)).decimals();
        if (curPosSize > strategy.maxPositionSize)
            revert Errors.EXCEED_MAX_POS_SIZE(strategyId);
    }

We see above that _validateMaxPosSize still uses the lpToken.balnceOf which as pointed out by [Issue 327](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry-judging/issues/327) from the previous contest does not actually prevent users from exceeding the max position size.

## Impact

Users can still bypass position size limit
