# The doCutVaultWithdrawFee() function will only cut fee if the blocktimestamp is less than withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime() + withdrawVaultFee Window

## Summary
The doCutVaultWithdrawFee() function will only cut fee if the blocktimestamp is less than withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime() + withdrawVaultFee Window
## Vulnerability Detail
According to this `IF statement` in the doCutVaultWithdrawFee() function
```solidity
        if (
            block.timestamp <
            config.withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime() +
                config.withdrawVaultFeeWindow()
        ) {}
``` 
The `_doCutFee` function will only be called when doCutVaultWithdrawFee() function is called within a blocktimestamp `<` the given `withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime() + withdrawVaultFeeWindow()` time/blocktimestamp. 

This is bad because i believe according to this comments by the devs
```solidity
    /// @notice Cut vault withdraw fee when perform withdraw from Blueberry Money Market within the given window
```
and
```solidity
        // Cut withdraw fee if it is in withdrawVaultFee Window
```
The `_doCutFee() function` is meant to be called when withdraw is performed from Blueberry Money Market _**within**_ the given window i.e `withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime() + withdrawVaultFeeWindow()` time/blocktimestamp, but here cut withdraw fees will only happen if its called in a period less than the given withdrawVaultFee Window.

## Impact
When withdraws are made from Blueberry Money Market within the given withdrawVaultFee Window, cut withdraw fee won't be done and treasury won't receive the withdraw fees.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
change the `IF statement` to this
```solidity
        if (
            block.timestamp ==
            config.withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime() +
                config.withdrawVaultFeeWindow()
        ) {
```
