# Hard Vault has no validation for depositing tokens other than LP tokens

## Summary

The deposit function of HardVault does not check if the user is trying to deposit a token that is not an LP token. This can lead to a loss of user funds if they accidentally deposit the wrong token.

## Vulnerability Detail

The deposit function of HardVault allows users to deposit any ERC20 token, not just LP tokens. This is because the function only checks if the amount parameter is zero or not, but does not check if the token parameter is a valid LP token.

## Impact

If a user accidentally deposits an ERC20 token that is not a valid LP token, the tokens will be locked in the HardVault contract and cannot be withdrawn. This can result in a loss of user funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The deposit function should be updated to check if the token parameter is a valid LP token. If the token is not a valid LP token, the function should revert with an appropriate error message.
