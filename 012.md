# Potential reentrancy vulnerability in withdrawLend function

## Summary

The withdrawLend function may be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit the function and steal funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The withdrawLend function transfers tokens to the message sender after reducing the user's vault share but before emitting the WithdrawLend event. If the token being withdrawn is malicious and has a callback to the withdrawLend function within its transfer function, it could lead to a reentrancy attack.

## Impact

An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to repeatedly withdraw tokens without updating the user's vault share, leading to a loss of funds for the contract and its users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a reentrancy guard to prevent reentrancy attacks. Alternatively, emit the WithdrawLend event before transferring tokens to the message sender.
