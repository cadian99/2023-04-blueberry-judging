# H-02  Aura SPELL is not compatible with Balancer pools

## Summary
The [AuraSpell.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/AuraSpell.sol) defines how Blueberry Protocol interacts with Aura pools.

## Vulnerability Detail
On the [openPositionFarm](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/AuraSpell.sol#L63-L95) at the third step
```solidity
        // 3. Add liquidity on Balancer, get BPT
        {
            IBalancerVault vault = wAuraPools.getVault(lpToken);
            _ensureApprove(param.borrowToken, address(vault), borrowBalance);

            (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory balances, ) = wAuraPools
                .getPoolTokens(lpToken);
            uint[] memory maxAmountsIn = new uint[](2);
            maxAmountsIn[0] = IERC20(tokens[0]).balanceOf(address(this));
            maxAmountsIn[1] = IERC20(tokens[1]).balanceOf(address(this));
```     
The elements (address) on the `tokens[ ]` array are the list of which tokens can hold by the pool, and it could contain two elements (2 address) to eight elements (8 address).        
this is one of the biggest pools on Balancer with three tokens USDC, DAI and USDT https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x79c58f70905f734641735bc61e45c19dd9ad60bc0000000000000000000004e7
But the `maxAmountsIn [ ]` can only take the two first indexes (token balance) from `tokens[ ]`.
The main goal here is to read the balance of `param.borrowToken` in this SPELL.
in case  `tokens[ ].length == 3` and the `param.borrowToken` address is in the least index on (e.g.tokens[3] == param.borrowToken) 
so the current strategy `param.strategyId` will never work

## Impact
- The AuraSpell.sol can't handle some Balancer pools correctly 
- The user will lose some fees if he invokes `increasePosition()` first, then he will fail to invoke `openPositionFarm()`

```solidity
        // 3. Add liquidity on Balancer, get BPT
        {
            IBalancerVault vault = wAuraPools.getVault(lpToken);
            _ensureApprove(param.borrowToken, address(vault), borrowBalance);

            (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory balances, ) = wAuraPools
                .getPoolTokens(lpToken);
            uint[] memory maxAmountsIn = new uint[](2);
            maxAmountsIn[0] = IERC20(tokens[0]).balanceOf(address(this));
            maxAmountsIn[1] = IERC20(tokens[1]).balanceOf(address(this));
```

## Recommendation
Check the `tokens[ ].length`
