# No Slippage Protection while removing liquidity from Curve Pool

## Summary

While Closing Position Farm in `convexSpell` and `curveSpell`, there is a use of `remove_liquidity_one_coin` method in Curve Pool to remove the liquidity. But the value of `_min_amount` is set to be zero which allow maximum Slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `closePositionFarm` method of all the 3 spell contracts, there is no valid slippage parameter set in `remove_liquidity_one_coin` method call. 

`remove_liquidity_one_coin` method is used to withdraw a single asset from the pool. It can take the following 3 parameters:

1. `_burn_amount`: Amount of LP tokens to burn in the withdrawal.

2. `i`: Index value of the coin to withdraw. Can be found using the coins getter method.

3. `_min_amount`: Minimum amount of the coin to receive

But in both ConvexSpell and CurveSpell contracts, the value of `_min_amount` is set to zero which means the contract is allowing to burn all the LP tokens but in return allowing to accept 0 tokens as a withdrawal amount. This leads to High Slippage issue.

## Impact

Loss of Funds.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: ConvexSpell.sol

  ICurvePool(pool).remove_liquidity_one_coin( 
      amountPosRemove,
      int128(tokenIndex),
      0
  );

```
