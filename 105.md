# M-01 user will not be able to close his position (run out of gas)

## Summary
The ConvexCurveLPVault.sol contract allows users to earn a yield on curve token deposits. Rewards are paid out in native CRV and CVX tokens but the reward manager of the base pool may opt to add extra rewards.
There is no guarantee that the tokens involved will be efficient in their use of gas, and there are no upper bounds on the number of extra rewards [check [here]()](https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/BaseRewardPool.sol#L105-L115)

## Vulnerability Detail
Because the reward manager has the ability to extend the list of extra rewards, they can extend it such that the [closePositionFarm()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/ConvexSpell.sol#L147-L230) function is unable to execute within a single block.

to close the farm position you should invoke this  function `ConvexSpell.closePositionFarm()` which has all the following loops
1- in [wConvexPools.burn()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WConvexPools.sol#L153-L163)
```solidity
        for (uint i = 0; i < extraRewardsCount; i++) {
            address rewarder = IRewarder(crvRewarder).extraRewards(i);
            uint256 stRewardPerShare = accExtPerShare[tokenId][i];
            tokens[i + 1] = IRewarder(rewarder).rewardToken();
            rewards[i + 1] = _getPendingReward(
                stRewardPerShare,
                rewarder,
                amount,
                lpDecimals
            );
        }
```
and this 
```solidity
        for (uint i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(
                msg.sender,
                rewards[i]
            );
        }
```
2- [Swap rewards tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/ConvexSpell.sol#L170-L181) on UniswapV2
```solidity
        // 2. Swap rewards tokens to debt token
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {//?@audit 4.1 - this part will add insult to injury 
            uint256 rewards = _doCutRewardsFee(rewardTokens[i]);
            _ensureApprove(rewardTokens[i], address(swapRouter), rewards);
            swapRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(
                rewards,
                0,
                swapPath[i],
                address(this),
                type(uint256).max
            );
        }
```
3- At the end `execute()` need to invoke [isLiquidatable()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L411-L413) which has this loop to get all the rewards value from the Oracle
```solidity
            for (uint256 i; i < tokens.length; i++) {
                rewardsValue += oracle.getTokenValue(tokens[i], rewards[i]);
            }
```
 As a result of all these loops together, the user's positions could only get liquidated 

## Impact
user will not be able to close his position because attempts to do so will revert (run out of gas)

## Recommendation
Consider restricting the number of extra rewards by only iterating through the first **X** number of tokens
