# Missing slippage control when closing position in AuraSpell

## Summary
Missing slippage control when closing position in AuraSpell

## Vulnerability Detail
There's no slippage control for minimum out tokens obtained.

## Impact
Farmers who close positions in AuraSpell can potentially get sandwich-attacked and get $0 value out. (the attacker can manipulate the pool so the swap gets very bad rate). Right now all swaps get 0 min token amount out for slippage control and there are no other checks.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Add slippage control to all tokens in the `closePositionFarm` function
