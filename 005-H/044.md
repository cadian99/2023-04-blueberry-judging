# The quotes from Curve may be subject to manipulation

## Summary
The `get_virtual_price()` function in Curve has a reentrancy risk, which can affect the price if the protocol fetches quotes from pools integrated with ETH on Curve.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `CurveOracle` protocol calls the function `get_virtual_price_from_lp_token()` to obtain a quote from Curve. However, all pools integrated with ETH pose a read-only reentrancy risk. Please refer below link for detail.

## Impact
The read-only reentrancy operation manipulates the price.
