# Possible stale values from Chainlink oracle

## Summary
Insufficient checks are made when receiving values from Chainlink oracle


## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
(, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = registry.latestRoundData(
            token,
            USD
        );
        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime)
            revert Errors.PRICE_OUTDATED(token_);
        if (answer <= 0) revert Errors.PRICE_NEGATIVE(token_);
```
When getting latestRoundData, the only variables checked are the `updatedAt` timestamp and the `answer`. According to [chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/historical-data#getrounddata-return-values), `answeredInRound` should be checked to be `== roundId`, 

> answeredInRound: The combination of aggregatorAnsweredInRound and phaseId. aggregatorAnsweredInRound: The round the answer was updated in. You can check answeredInRound against the current roundId. If answeredInRound is less than roundId, the answer is being carried over. If answeredInRound is equal to roundId, then the answer is fresh.

## Impact
Stale price might be carried over

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add the following check 
```solidity
        require(answeredInRound == roundID, "Stale price");
```
