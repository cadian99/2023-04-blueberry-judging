# openPositionFarm() doesn't check to make sure the pool gotten via the getPool() function is a valid and existing pool

## Summary
openPositionFarm() in AuraSpell.sol doesn't check to make sure the pool gotten via the getPool() function is a valid and existing pool
## Vulnerability Detail
checking the IWAuraPools.sol interface i see `getPool()` returns address and uint256.

`openPositionFarm() function` in AuraSpell.sol uses `IWAuraPools.getPool()` to get pools but doesn't check the returned parameters to confirm if the pool returned is a valid and existing pool.

## Impact
An invalid and non-existing pool can be used by AuraSpell.sol's openPositionFarm() function

## Recommendation
check the returned parameters of getPool() function to ensure what is returned is an existing pool
