# Reentrancy vulnerability in IBank.sol

## Summary

The IBank contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. Specifically, the liquidate function can be called by an attacker multiple times before the state changes are finalized, allowing the attacker to withdraw more than they should.

## Vulnerability Detail

The liquidate function calls the withdrawLend function, which is not protected against reentrancy. This means that an attacker can call the liquidate function multiple times before the state changes are finalized, allowing them to withdraw more than they should.

## Impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to steal funds from the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this vulnerability, the `withdrawLend` function should be updated to include a reentrancy guard. A simple fix could be to add the `nonReentrant` modifier to the `withdrawLend` function, similar to the `liquidate` function. Alternatively, the `withdrawLend` function could be modified to use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to avoid reentrancy attacks.
