# `BalancePairOracal.sol#computeFairReserves` function does not consider the decimals

## Summary

`BalancePairOracal.sol#computeFairReserves` function does not consider the decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: oracle/BalancerPairOracle.sol
 53         uint256 r0 = resA / resB;
 54         uint256 r1 = (wA * pxB) / (wB * pxA);
```

- `resA`: the balances of token A
- `resB`: the balances of token B
- `pxA`: the price of token A
- `pxB`: the price of token B
- `wA`: the weight of token A
- `wB`: the weight of token B

Lines 53 and 54 do not consider decimals, this can lead to very large calculation errors. For example, the decimals of token A is 8 and the decimals of token B is 18, then `r0` is almost always 0.

## Impact

The `computeFairReserves` function is used to calculate prices, which can lead to very large price errors.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to consider the decimal places of token and price.
