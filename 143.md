# `AuraSpell`'s Balancer pool join will always revert

## Summary

In `AuraSpell.openPositionFarm`, the call to `BalancerVault.joinPool` is not properly encoded and will always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

All Balancer Vault operations include an input argument called `userData`. This is optional for all known swaps, but it is very much required for all known joins and exits. In `AuraSpell.openPositionFarm`, a call to `BalancerVault.joinPool` leaves the `userData` empty. As a result, the join will always revert, and it will be impossible to open a position.

## Impact

It is not possible to open a position using the `AuraSpell`.

## Code Snippet

[spell/AuraSpell.sol#L109-119](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/AuraSpell.sol#L109-L119), annotated below for clarity.

```solidity
vault.joinPool(
    poolId,
    address(this),
    address(this),
    IBalancerVault.JoinPoolRequest(
        tokens,
        maxAmountsIn,
        "", // @audit-info This is the `userData` argument, which has been left empty.
        false
    )
);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

First, create an integration test for the Aura spell. There are tests for Convex, Curve, and Ichi, but not Aura. A test would likely have caught this issue.

To fix the issue, consult the [Balancer docs on pool joins](https://docs.balancer.fi/reference/joins-and-exits/pool-joins.html). Specifically, we probably want the "exact tokens" join type, whose `userData` looks like:

```solidity
[uint256, uint256[], uint256]
[EXACT_TOKENS_IN_FOR_BPT_OUT, amountsIn, minimumBPT]
```

Note that this will also require specifying the `minimumBPT` that we will get out. We may have to leverage an oracle in order to compute this amount.
