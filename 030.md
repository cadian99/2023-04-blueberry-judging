# HardVault.sol ,the function deposit() does not check the token

## Summary
In HardVault.sol ,the function deposit() does not check the token.if token is a malicious token contract ,it could tranfer a large number token to HardVault.
## Vulnerability Detail

Overall, this function appears to be secure, but it should be noted that if token is a malicious token contract, it could tranfer a large number token to HardVault. Therefore, we should ensure that only trusted token contract addresses are accepted as parameters.

## Impact

Affect the normal use of functions

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/vault/HardVault.sol#L105

    function deposit(
        address token,
        uint256 amount
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256 shareAmount) {
        if (amount == 0) revert Errors.ZERO_AMOUNT();
        IERC20Upgradeable uToken = IERC20Upgradeable(token);
        uint256 uBalanceBefore = uToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        uToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        uint256 uBalanceAfter = uToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        shareAmount = uBalanceAfter - uBalanceBefore;
        _mint(msg.sender, uint256(uint160(token)), shareAmount, "");

        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount, shareAmount);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

we should ensure that only trusted token contract addresses are accepted as parameters, and use the whitelist.
