# No checks if Arbitrum sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
In Q&A section Blueberry mentioned that contracts will be deployed on Mainnet and Arbitrum chains.

When using Chainlink on second-layer chains such as Arbitrum, it is required to ensure that the sequencer is up to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not.
## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check made to sequencer
```solidity
function getPrice(address token_) external view override returns (uint256) {
        // remap token if possible
        address token = remappedTokens[token_];
        if (token == address(0)) token = token_;

        uint256 maxDelayTime = timeGaps[token];
        if (maxDelayTime == 0) revert Errors.NO_MAX_DELAY(token_);

        // Get token-USD price
        uint256 decimals = registry.decimals(token, USD);
        (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = registry.latestRoundData(
            token,
            USD
        );
        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime)
            revert Errors.PRICE_OUTDATED(token_);
        if (answer <= 0) revert Errors.PRICE_NEGATIVE(token_);

        return
            (answer.toUint256() * Constants.PRICE_PRECISION) / 10 ** decimals;
    }
```
## Impact
Can be exploited by malicious users to get an advantage.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would recommend to create a 2 different contracts - one for Mainnet and one for Arbitrum, where the sequencer is checked.
