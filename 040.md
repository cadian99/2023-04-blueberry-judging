# getPrice() doesn't check If Arbitrum sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
Not checking if the sequencer is down may result in bd actors obtaining inconsistent and unfair prices.

## Vulnerability Detail
When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.
Example:https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code
There is no check in the ChainlinkAdapterOracle.sol
```solidity
function getPrice(address token_) external view override returns (uint256) {
        // remap token if possible
        address token = remappedTokens[token_];
        if (token == address(0)) token = token_;

        uint256 maxDelayTime = timeGaps[token];
        if (maxDelayTime == 0) revert Errors.NO_MAX_DELAY(token_);

        // Get token-USD price
        uint256 decimals = registry.decimals(token, USD);
        (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = registry.latestRoundData(
            token,
            USD
        );
        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime)
            revert Errors.PRICE_OUTDATED(token_);
        if (answer <= 0) revert Errors.PRICE_NEGATIVE(token_);

        return
            (answer.toUint256() * Constants.PRICE_PRECISION) / 10 ** decimals;
    }

```

## Impact
Could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.
