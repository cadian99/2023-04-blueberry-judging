# setWithdrawVaultFeeWindow(...) function in ProtocolConfig.sol does not convert days input parameter in the corresponding uint value

## Summary
**setWithdrawVaultFeeWindow(...)** function in **ProtocolConfig.sol** does not convert days input parameter in the corresponding uint value.

## Vulnerability Detail
Your tests fail. It seems that you want to specify the number of days as parameter but the function did not convert that to uint256 corresponding value.

Test results:
```console
Protocol Config
    ✔ owner should be able to start vault withdraw fee
    1) owner should be able to set vault withdraw fee window
    ...
    Constructor
        ✔ should revert initializing twice
        ✔ should revert when treasury address is invalid
        1) should set initial states on constructor
```

## Impact
This may leed to unexpected behaviour if the user expect to set the parameter in days.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider this changes. In **ProtocolConfig.sol**:
```solidity
/**
* @dev Owner priviledged function to set withdraw vault fee window 
*/
function setWithdrawVaultFeeWindow(uint256 withdrawVaultFeeWindow_) external onlyOwner {
    // Cap to 60 days
    if (withdrawVaultFeeWindow_ * 1 days > Constants.MAX_WITHDRAW_VAULT_FEE_WINDOW) {
        revert Errors.FEE_WINDOW_TOO_LONG(withdrawVaultFeeWindow_);
    }
    withdrawVaultFeeWindow = withdrawVaultFeeWindow_ * 1 days;
}
```
In **config.test.ts**:
```typescript
it("owner should be able to set vault withdraw fee window", async () => {
    await expect(
        config.connect(alice).setWithdrawVaultFeeWindow(90)
    ).to.be.revertedWith("Ownable: caller is not the owner");
    await expect(
        config.setWithdrawVaultFeeWindow(120)
    ).to.be.revertedWith("FEE_WINDOW_TOO_LONG");

    await config.setWithdrawVaultFeeWindow(60); // changed from 90 to 60 because the max value is MAX_WITHDRAW_VAULT_FEE_WINDOW = 60 days;
    expect(await config.withdrawVaultFeeWindow()).to.be.equal(60 * 24 * 60 * 60);
})
```
```typescript
it("should set initial states on constructor", async () => {
    expect(await config.depositFee()).to.be.equal(50);
    expect(await config.withdrawFee()).to.be.equal(50);
    expect(await config.treasuryFeeRate()).to.be.equal(3000);
    expect(await config.blbStablePoolFeeRate()).to.be.equal(3500);
    expect(await config.blbIchiVaultFeeRate()).to.be.equal(3500);
    expect(await config.withdrawVaultFee()).to.be.equal(100);
    expect(await config.withdrawVaultFeeWindow()).to.be.equal(60 * 24 * 60 * 60); // changed here
    expect(await config.withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime()).to.be.equal(0);
})
```
